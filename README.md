### 3rd party Libraries Used

<ul>Retrofit: Networking library used for making API calls which provides an easy API for making REST calls and 
also parsing the JSON response</ul>

<ul>RxJava: Used because it simplifies doing asynchronous work, remove a lot of boilerplate code required for making 
network calls in general. Also it's compatible with Retrofit and network response can be parsed into Observable streams</ul>

<ul>Picasso: Image Loading library which handles caching and loading of images over network</ul>
